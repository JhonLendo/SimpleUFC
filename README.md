# SimpleUFC
Just my simple ufc project. Made in a day.

/fight <player> - Challenge a player. If you have been challenged, just type /fight <whoChallengedYou> to accept the match.
/fightqueue - Enters the queue. You may fight with someone totally random.
/ufc - Admin commands:
/ufc setspawn [ONE/TWO] - Set spawn location for player ONE or TWO.
/ufc stopall - Stops all the on going fights.
/ufc setfallback - Set the location where players are going to be teleported back when they're done.
  
  There is a config If you don't wanna change the code for some reason. Cya.
